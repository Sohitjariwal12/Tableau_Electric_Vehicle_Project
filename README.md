# ⚡Introducing My Electric Vehicle Dashboard on Tableau!⚡
I’ve created a detailed and interactive Tableau dashboard to explore the world of electric vehicles (EVs). As the shift toward sustainable transportation accelerates, this dashboard is designed to provide valuable insights into key trends, infrastructure, and performance metrics in the EV market.

🎯 Project Overview:
In this Tableau mission, I've explored several vital factors of the EV panorama: 
✅ **EV Adoption Growth** – Tracking how electric cars are being followed globally 📊 
✅ **Charging Station Distribution** – Mapping the availability of charging stations through place ⚡ 
✅ **EV Battery Performance** – Understanding the efficiency and lifespan of EV batteries 🔋 
✅ **Market Share of Leading EV Brands** – Analyzing which agencies dominate the EV marketplace 🚗 
✅ **Impact of Local Policies on EV Adoption** – How government rules are shaping the future of electrical vehicles 🌍 
✅ **EV Infrastructure Readiness** – Assessing how organized present day infrastructure is for future demand 🏙️ 

📈 Why It’s Valuable:
This dashboard allows absolutely everyone interested in the future of electrical automobiles—whether or not you're a policymaker, business chief, or EV enthusiast—make records-driven decisions to guide a sustainable, green future.
